## 1. Game characteristics (30)

For each of the following statements, say whether it is true or false and provide a short (e.g. one paragraph) justification for your answer.

1.1 Given a two-player, turn-taking, zero-sum, fully observable game between two perfectly rational players, it does not help the first player's outcome to know what strategy the second player is using -- that is, what move the second player will make, given the first player's move.
